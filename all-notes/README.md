# Notes of all commands during the pracice exercises

In this folder you will find 
my private notes that I used 
for preparing to the recordings 
of the practice exercises, 
with some cleaning up.

# Important!

**AS THIS WAS ONLY THE BASE FOR THE LIVE RECORDING, THERE MIGHT BE SOME DIFFERENCES.
DUE TO THIS, THIS IS NOT PART OF THE OFFICIAL LEARNING MATERIAL.**

This means, that what you see in the videos
is the canonical and correct version.
If there is any difference, refer to the live recording.
Please do not say, that 
you try something that is written down 
in these notes and why does not it work, it should work.
In that case check back the video 
(obviously if something is not working 
that is in the video, you should ask about that).

Also note, that from the 4th week, there are some changes in numbering or host names.
Always refer to the code snippets first!

Main differences that you might encounter:

- placeholders are filled with my data (my name, my GitHub username, etc.) - you must replace these with your own
- I might have done a mistake during the recording the first time, but decided to not cut it out, instead show how to fix the wrong command - probably you will find only the correct command in these notes
- there might be some mistakes even in these notes (syntactical or semantical)
- a live recording may have improvisation anytime - adding some stuff, or removing some
- the notes are designed for Windows (as I recorded everything on Windows) - there might be differences between Linux Shell and PowerShell, for example:
  - how to set and resolve environment variables
  - how to do multi-line commands (in PowerShell a ` sign is at the end of line, in Linux Shell it should be a \ sign)
  - escaping and quotations

Note, that the notes do not contain detailed explanations 
and instructions, these are available for 
an easier way to check back for commands.

I still recommend typing in the commands manually 
(except for the official code snippets), 
as this way there will be a higher chance 
that later on you can reproduce it.

## Side notes

There might be some code snippets, 
that may seem copyable, 
but can not be used,
as it also contains some explanations.
Always check what you copy, whether it is a correct command.

This material is currently 
not 100% in sync with the recordings.
However, you can help me correct this.
If you find a place where there is a difference (or something just doesn't work), 
please report it to me, with the following help:

- where is it in the video (time code, minutes:seconds)
- where is it in these notes
